\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item This lab was an introduction to {\bfseries{linux, makefiles, C and Unit Tests}}
\item We had to produce a makefile that could run the code
\item We wrote functions to get the factorial of a given number and to use the fibonacci sequence
\item Then we had to make unit tests to test if the functions worked
\item The last step was to compile all of this using the makefile and check if the tests ran

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Open and examine all files. (use emacs or vim)
\item Compile the test example using the Makefile
\item Complete the code in \doxylink{stuff_8c}{stuff.\+c}
\item Complete the Doxygen comments in the file
\item Create test cases for this file
\item Add rules for compiling this file in the Makefile
\item Compile using make
