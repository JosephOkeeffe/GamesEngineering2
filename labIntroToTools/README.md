## What is the lab?
1. This lab was an introduction to **linux, makefiles, C and Unit Tests**
2. We had to produce a makefile that could run the code
3. We wrote functions to get the factorial of a given number and to use the fibonacci sequence 
4. Then we had to make unit tests to test if the functions worked
5. The last step was to compile all of this using the makefile and check if the tests ran

# What to do
1. Open and examine all files. (use emacs or vim)
2. Compile the test example using the Makefile
3. Complete the code in stuff.c
4. Complete the Doxygen comments in the file
5. Create test cases for this file
6. Add rules for compiling this file in the Makefile 
7. Compile using make
